This is a [final project](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/30_Day_Mini_project_final/30_day_mini_project_final.md) from the [30daysofjavascript repo](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript).

This project was done to test the level of my JavaScript skills and my logic thinking. Also, I stored the data in a json file and called it using the Ajax method so I could familiarize myself with this particular method for calling apis, and I can say it was a success.
